The provided code implements a stock trading engine using linked lists to manage buy and sell orders. It uses a lock to ensure thread safety when accessing and modifying the order books. Let's break down the key components and how they handle race conditions:

Key Components:
OrderNode:
Represents an individual order in the linked list with attributes for order type, ticker symbol, quantity, price, and a pointer to the next node.

OrderBook:
Manages buy and sell orders using separate linked lists. Orders are inserted in sorted order based on price.
The add_order method inserts a new order into the appropriate list.
The match_orders method matches buy and sell orders based on price and quantity, executing trades when conditions are met.

StockExchange:
Manages multiple OrderBook instances, one for each ticker symbol.
Uses a lock (threading.Lock) to ensure that only one thread can access or modify an order book at a time, preventing race conditions.
simulate_orders:
Simulates the addition of random orders to the stock exchange, mimicking real-time trading activity.

Handling Race Conditions:
Locking Mechanism:
The StockExchange class uses a lock to ensure that the add_order and match_orders methods are thread-safe. This prevents multiple threads from modifying the order books concurrently, which could lead to inconsistent states.
Thread Safety:
The lock ensures that the critical sections of code that modify the order books are executed atomically. This means that once a thread acquires the lock, no other thread can enter the critical section until the lock is released.
